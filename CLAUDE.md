# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python project with a simple Anthropic Claude API quickstart example. The project uses a Python virtual environment located in `claude-env/`.

## Development Environment

The project uses Python 3.12.4 with a virtual environment managed through venv. To work with this project:

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source claude-env/bin/activate
   ```

2. Run the quickstart script:
   ```bash
   python claude_quickstart.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `claude_quickstart.py` - Main script demonstrating Anthropic API usage
- `claude-env/` - Python virtual environment containing dependencies

## Dependencies

The project uses the `anthropic` Python SDK for API interactions. Dependencies are installed in the virtual environment.
